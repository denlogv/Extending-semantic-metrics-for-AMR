To achieve this, the programmer has to note generalisations and similarities about various aspects of the program.	Terms are basically the words or any indexing unit used to identify the contents of a text.	plagiarism	0.0
However an object cannot be cast to a class which is no relative of it.	Here by meaning that a program can be an optimal plan for the produced action.	plagiarism	0.0
This means that inheritance is used when types have common factors and these would be put into the superclass.	Occasionally it is advantageous to differentiate between these uses, as it is not necessarily noticeable from context.	plagiarism	0.0
This means that inheritance is used when types have common factors and these would be put into the superclass.	This can be useful when the number of times a word appears is not considered important.	plagiarism	0.0
The way that a 'term' is defined depends on the application.	The easiest way to look at inheritance is as an “…is a kind of” relationship.	plagiarism	0.0
"Therefore, the ""program"" is the optimal plan for action that is produced."	Since the PageRank is the most important algorithms which is used in the Google engine.	plagiarism	0.0
Without a proof of correctness, such an algorithm is likely to fail.	However an object cannot be cast to a class which is no relative of it.	plagiarism	0.0
The other method is the top down approach which is a method that combines memorization and recursion.	Since the PageRank is the most important algorithms which is used in the Google engine.	plagiarism	0.0
Thus, the program is the best plan for action that is produced.	After this, it is using this to pick the best overall path.	plagiarism	0.0
This can be useful when the number of times a word appears is not considered important.	It has no relationship to computer programming; instead it is a process of finding a satisfactory algorithm.	plagiarism	0.0
Then, using this, the best overall path can be found, thereby demonstrating the dynamic programming principle.	The further down an inheritance tree you get, the more specific the classes become.	plagiarism	0.0
To achieve this, the programmer has to note generalisations and similarities about various aspects of the program.	It is similar to divide and conquer, however is differentiated as its subproblems are not independent.	plagiarism	0.0
The further down an inheritance tree you get, the more specific the classes become.	The differing application has a direct influence on what the definition of the term means.	plagiarism	0.0
The easiest way to look at inheritance is as an “…is a kind of” relationship.	"It also provides a way to generalize du to the ""is a"" relationship between classes."	plagiarism	0.0
This means that inheritance is used when types have common factors and these would be put into the superclass.	"It is ""prior"" in the sense that it does not take into account any information about B."	plagiarism	0.0
This means that inheritance is used when types have common factors and these would be put into the superclass.	The method can be abused when people deliberately link to sites in order to raise a site's PageRank.	plagiarism	0.0
