One of the most popular schemes is tf-idf weighting.	One of the best known schemes is tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency) weighting.	plagiarism	
Dynamic Programming solves problems by combining the solutions of subproblems.	Dynamic Programming reduces computation time by solving subproblems in a ‘bottom-up’ way.	plagiarism	
The method can be abused when people deliberately link to sites in order to raise a site's PageRank.	A dampening factor is used to counter random surfers, who get bored and then switch to other pages.	plagiarism	
If a term occurs in the document, its value is non-zero.	Term frequency: This formula counts how many times the term occurs in a document.	plagiarism	
If the term doesn’t occur within the document, the value in the vector is zero.	Vector space representation results in the loss of the order which the terms are in the document.	plagiarism	
If the term doesn’t occur within the document, the value in the vector is zero.	The order in which the terms appear in the document is lost in the vector space representation.	plagiarism	
The algebraic model for representing text documents and objects as vectors of identifiers is called the vector space model.	In the vector space model a document is represented as a vector.	plagiarism	
The vector space model has the following limitations: 1.	The vector space model has several disadvantages.	plagiarism	
If the term doesn’t occur within the document, the value in the vector is zero.	The value of a vector is non-zero if a term occurs in the document.	plagiarism	
The second method is the use of links.	One of the most important uses of page rank is its meaning to advertising.	plagiarism	
Most of these languages provide an “extend” keyword, which is used to subclass another.	However an object cannot be cast to a class which is no relative of it.	plagiarism	
Inheritance is a basic concept in object oriented programming.	Inheritance is one of the basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming.	plagiarism	
Construct an optimal solution from computed values.	Construct an optimal solution, using the computed optimal subproblems, for the original problem.	plagiarism	
Inheritance in object oriented programming is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined.	Inheritance is a method of forming new classes using predefined classes.	plagiarism	
It is intended to help reuse existing code with little or no modification.	The peropos of inheritance in object oriented programming is to minimize the reuse of existing code without modification.	plagiarism	
The order in which terms appear in the document is lost in a vector space representation.	If a term occurs in the document, its value is non-zero.	plagiarism	
A document has representation as a vector.	Each document is a vector where each word is a dimension.	plagiarism	
The vector space model are the documents which are represented as “bags of words”.	However, the vector space model has limitations.	plagiarism	
Most of these languages provide an “extend” keyword, which is used to subclass another.	In general, dynamic programming is used on optimisation problems, where the most efficient solution is needed.	plagiarism	
A link to a page is seen as a vote of support.	A hyperlink to a page counts as a vote of support.	plagiarism	
With each separate term corresponding to the differing dimensions.	A document is represented as a vector, with each dimension corresponding to a separate term.	plagiarism	
If a term exists in a document, its value in the vector is not equal to zero.	The order in which terms appear in the document is lost in a vector space representation.	plagiarism	
P(B|A) is the conditional probability of B given A.	P(B) is the prior or marginal probability of B, and acts as a normalizing constant.	plagiarism	
In Java all attributes and methods are implicitly virtual.	For example private attributes and methods cannot be inherited.	plagiarism	
If a term exists in a document, its value in the vector is not equal to zero.	However an object cannot be cast to a class which is no relative of it.	plagiarism	
Bayes Theorem is a mathematical formula used to calculate conditional probabilities.	It is usually used to calculate posterior probabilities given observations.	plagiarism	
This means that inheritance is used when types have common factors and these would be put into the superclass.	Terms are basically the words or any indexing unit used to identify the contents of a text.	plagiarism	
Dynamic Programming solves problems by combining the solutions of subproblems.	In computer science; dynamic programming is a way of solving problems consist of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.	plagiarism	
Furthermore, by combining solutions to subproblems, DP solves problems.	Like divide and conquer, Dynamic Programming solves problems by combining solutions to sub-problems.	plagiarism	
It is therefore used to create relationships between one object and another.	However an object cannot be cast to a class which is no relative of it.	plagiarism	
Generate the optimal solution of these computed values	Define value of optimal solution recursively.	plagiarism	
It is used in information filtering, information retrieval, indexing and relevancy rankings.	It was used in the first time in the SMART Information Retrieval System.	plagiarism	
Instead, a new object is made to inherit properties of objects which already exist.	For example, a program could exist to model different forms of transport.	plagiarism	
The easiest way to look at inheritance is as an “…is a kind of” relationship.	Most of these languages provide an “extend” keyword, which is used to subclass another.	plagiarism	
P(B) is the prior or marginal probability of B, and acts to normalise the probability.	• P(B|A) is the conditional probability of B given A.	plagiarism	
It is used to compute posterior probabilities given observations.	It is usually used to calculate posterior probabilities given observations.	plagiarism	
Inheritance is one of the basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming.	Inheritance is an important feature in object orientated programming.	plagiarism	
Dangling, links to a page which has no links to others.	If there are no links to a web page there is no support for that page.	plagiarism	
Other possible uses for vector space models are indexing and also to rank the relevancy of differing documents.	In vector space model, the documents from which the information is to be retrieved are represented as vectors.	plagiarism	
This can be useful when the number of times a word appears is not considered important.	Mathematicians use the word to describe a set of rules which anyone can follow to solve a problem.	plagiarism	
The last point would be to construct an optimal solution from the computed values.	Generalise the structure of an optimal solution 2.	plagiarism	
Every dimension is precisely related to a separate term.	Each dimension corresponds to a separate term.	plagiarism	
As a formal theorem, Bayes' theorem is valid in all common interpretations of probability.	Bayes' Theorem is a theorem of probability theory originally stated by the Reverend Thomas Bayes.	plagiarism	
This means that inheritance is used when types have common factors and these would be put into the superclass.	It does not take into account any information about B and therefore is considered “prior”.	plagiarism	
It is used in information retrieval and was first used in the SMART Information Retrieval System.	It is used in information filtering, indexing, relevancy rankings and information retrieval.	plagiarism
